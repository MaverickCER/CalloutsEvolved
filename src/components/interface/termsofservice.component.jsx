        This Exhibit A to the Terms of Service (“TOS”) describes the further
        provisions which apply to the Binding Arbitration and Class Action
        Waiver.
      </p>
      <p>
        A. <u>Disputes</u>. A dispute is any controversy between You and
        Callouts&nbsp;Evolved concerning the Services, any software related to

        the best efforts process to resolve disputes, and prior to initiating
        arbitration proceedings, each party agrees to provide notice of the
        dispute to the other party, including a description of the dispute, what
        efforts have been made to resolve it, and what the disputing party is
        requesting as resolution, to MaverickCER@gmail.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        B. <u>Small Claims Court Available</u>. You may initiate an action in
        your local Small Claims Court if You meets the court’s requirements.
        However, if such a claim is transferred, removed or appealed to a
        different court, Callouts&nbsp;Evolved reserves the right to require
        arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
        C. <u>Arbitration Procedure</u>.Disputes not resolved pursuant to
        Section A or B shall be resolved through arbitration. The American
        Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will conduct any arbitration under its
        Commercial Arbitration Rules. For more information, see{" "}
        <a href="https://www.adr.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
          www.adr.org
        </a>
        . Arbitration hearings will take place in Your federal judicial
        district. A single arbitrator will be appointed. The arbitrator must:
        (a) follow all applicable substantive Law; (b) follow applicable
        statutes of limitations; (c) honor valid claims of privilege; (d) issue
        a written decision including the reasons for the award. The arbitrator
        may award damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and costs
        (including reasonable attorneys’ fees). Any arbitration award may be
        enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction.
        Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction,
        including the arbitrability of any claim; however, a court has exclusive
        authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide
        basis or in a representative capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        D. <u>Arbitration Fees</u>. If You are unable to afford the arbitration
        costs, Callouts&nbsp;Evolved will advance those costs to You, subject to
        the arbitrator’s determination if costs should be reimbursed to
        Callouts&nbsp;Evolved if Callouts&nbsp;Evolved prevails. For disputes
        involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing
        fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        E. <u>Conflict with AAA Rules</u>. This Agreement governs if there is a
        conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        F. <u>Requirement to File Within One Year</u>. Notwithstanding any other
        statute of limitations, a claim or dispute under this Agreement must be
        filed in Small Claims Court or noticed for arbitration within one year
        of when it could first be filed, or such claim will be permanently
        barred.
      </p>
      <p>
        G. <u>Severability</u>. If the class action waiver is found to be
        illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then
        those parts will not be arbitrated but will be resolved in court, with
        the balance resolved through arbitration. If any provision of this
        Exhibit A is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision
        will be severed; however, the remaining provisions shall still apply and
        shall be interpreted to as nearly as possible achieve the original
        intent of this Exhibit, inclusive of the severed provision.
