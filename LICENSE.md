# AGPLv3.0 with Derivative Works and Trademark Protection

*This is the GNU Affero General Public License as amended to include specific provisions for derivative works and trademark protection. It is a free software license, but it requires any modified or derivative works to meet certain conditions and includes protections for the original product owners.*

## Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program, provided you conform to the terms of the license for each work.

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License, applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Affero General Public License (AGPL). The "Program," below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification.") Each licensee is addressed as "you."

## Derivative Works and Source Code Distribution

1. Any and all derivative works based on the Program must be forked from the original product's GitHub repository, and their source code must be made available to the public under the terms of this license.

## Trademark Protection

2. You may not use any names associated with "Acces Game Chat," "Callouts Evolved," "Jarvis99-40," or "MaverickCER" to identify or promote derivative works of this Program without the explicit written permission of the original product owners.

## Legal Protection

3. The original product owners of the Program are provided with legal protection against any and all legal issues that may arise from the use, modification, or distribution of derivative works based on this Program. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the original product owners from any claims, suits, or actions arising out of the use, modification, or distribution of derivative works.

## Termination

4. If you violate the terms and conditions of this license, your rights under this license will terminate automatically.

## Disclaimer of Warranty

5. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.

## Limitation of Liability

6. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## End of Terms and Conditions

**How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs**

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
