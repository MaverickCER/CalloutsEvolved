Step 2: Install Soundplant43.exe
1. Right click on "Soundplant43.exe" and click run as administrator. 
2. The Setup application will guide you through the proccess. 
3. At "Select Additional Tasks", under "File extensions:", make sure that the checkbox for "Associate .keymap files with Soundplant 43" stays checked.
Step 3: Unzip the files by dragging the "soundboard" folder to your desktop. 
Step 4: First time start
1. Double click to open the "Soundboard" folder on your desktop. 
2. Double click to start "Crota's End.keymap" 
3. The Soundplant 43 app will start and give you a pop up.
4. Click on "Locate file...", "Desktop", "Soundboard", "Sounds", and find the missing file mentioned at the top left of the window.
5. Double click on the missing file, let Soundplant 43 populate, and then click the "save keymap" button at the top left of the window. It looks like a floppy disk.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each raid keymap. 
Step 5: Preparing for the raid!
1. You will need several items
	- A windows or mac computer with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, Soundplant, and the audio files installed.
	- This 4-pole audio cable (4ft): https://www.amazon.com/ARCHEER-Auxiliary-Extension-Headphone-Smartphone/dp/B01N0V809K/
	- This 4-pole splitter cable: https://www.amazon.com/ENVEL-Convertors-Smartphone-Microphone-Simultaneously/dp/B01M0T6PSF/ 
	- A PS4 / Xbox controller* Note: xbox controllers need a 3.5mm jack or an "Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter"
	- Any keyboard (USB/Bluetooth/doesn't matter) 
	- OPTIONAL: If you want to be more than ~3 feet from your windows device you will need some extension cables. 
		a. Must be a "4 pole audio extension cable" https://www.amazon.com/Zeskit-Braided-Nylon-Premium-Audio/dp/B00S1R7F2U/
		b. A bluetooth keyboard is great, but if you have usb then get this: https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Extension-Cable-Male-Female/dp/B00NH11PEY/
	-Additional Considerations: If you have a laptop you may want to get a usb keyboard so that you don't have to game with the laptop restricting you. 
2. Setting up the hardware
	- Plug the black single end of the 4-pole splitter cable into the computer's 3.5 mm headphone (not microphone) jack. 
	- Plug the one end of the 4-pole audio cable into the pink microphone end of 4-pole splitter cable.s
		*If you are using an extention cable then plug the one end of the 4-pole extension cable into the pink microphone end of 4-pole splitter cable and then plug the audio cable into the extension cable.
	- Plug the other end of the 4-pole audio cable into the controller's 3.5 mm headphone jack or into the "Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter"
	- Double check all connections from the computer to the controller.
Step 6: Time to Raid! 
1. With the hardware setup open one of the raid keymaps.
2. Join the party of your raid group and introduce yourself by pressing the "i" key on the keyboard.
	- Note: There is a setting in the top menu bar called "background key input" with an on / off toggle. 
	- If off is lightly shaded then you must click on the soundplant app for the sounds to start.
	- If on is lightly shaded then the keyboard will make the callouts regardless of what you're doing (I don't recommend this as sending a text message could lead to a LOT of noise) 
3. After double checking that the sound is working and your teammates can hear the callouts you're all set. 
	- Troubleshooting: If your teammates can't hear you then double check the connections in all the cables and turn up the volume on your computer. 
	- If your teammates still can't hear you make sure that you're not muted in the party and that the mute button hasn't been pressed on the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter
	- Make sure that the "headphones" or "speakers" are set as the defualt audio device. Use youtube to see how this works.
	- If you're still having issues then get a friend to check the cables on other devices to see which part is broken. 

Finally, Soundplant is a tool to be utilized by each person individually. The full version without pop ups and additional support can be purchased here: http://soundplant.org/spfaq.htm 
However, a purchase of soundplant is in no way required for you to use this amazing tool.
