## The Role of Callouts Evolved in Destiny 2
It is well known that the developers of Destiny 2 have put a lot of work into making sure that their game remains accessible. From their custom controller support, key rebinding, subtitles, color profiles, and soon to be implemented full-auto game play features, it is clear that they care. This is the first step in creating a more accessible environemnt that is welcoming to all kinds of players. The lead up to their Lightfall announcement showcased just how varried the community is and how far they're willing to go to share this experience with others.  

Of course, no system is perfect. The community has asked numerous times for some of these features to be expanded. Walking around the tower, a social area in game, the NPCs cycle through dialogue. This experience simply doesn't appear in the subtitles and the deaf community misses out on the changing atmosphere that makes the social space feel more alive. Another such example is actually a conscious decision by the team at Bungie. They want to make their end game activities more difficult by restricting information to specific members of the team and encouraging communication. This philosophy was first introduced in the Leviathan raid where only runners could see which arrows to shoot while going around the gauntlet, and it is still present in the newest raid.  

This philosophy makes the activities more difficult, encourages teams to bond through communication, and is one of the best solutions to increasing difficulty in end game content. Unfortunately, it provides fuel to an already established "Mic Required" culture. The revised Oryx encounter is a prime example of this. The old version allowed gamers to jump on plates in a static order and everyone knew when they had to get on. This pattern has been randomized in Destiny 2 and less players are involved in the process. This makes the "Mic Required" community subset feel comfortable, not only asking to be told which plate needs to be activated, but also requesting that their gamer name is specifically told to activate the specific plate.  

Despite an otherwise welcoming community, the "Mic Required" culture specifically excludes players that cannot use sound based communication, especially when special requests need to be accomodated. That is why, our dream at Callouts Evolved is to to allow gamers to communicate effectively using their preferred methods. While we have a long ways to go before this dream is a reality, we are excited to see that our current infrastructure will fully support these types of callouts. Meanwhile, our Blog will continue to explore and breakdown the visual cues of Destiny raids, provide guides as to how our sessions can be used to complete different challenges, and explore accessibility efforts across the gaming industry.
