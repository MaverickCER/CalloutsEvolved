## How Blog Posts Will Function at Callouts Evolved
All blogs will be written in markdown format from within a custom authors only guild. The guild will have channels dedicated to writing, researching, and reviewing the blog post. The original writer will be the only person who can edit the blog content. Once the blog post is written, editors can provide suggestions to correct spelling/grammar or provide proper citations.  

Another blog channel will be dedicated to verifying that all legal requirements are met. Can we use all the images? If citation is required for the image, has it been provided? If permission was provided for us to use an image with or without citation, where is the proof? Is the blog content plagerised? If so, do we have permission to show it? etc...

Once a blog post has been written, it can be reviewed. If the reviewer makes suggestions it will go back to the writter to implement the suggestions or address them another way and send it back out for review. Once approved by a reviewer, the writer can make additional edits (whish will require approval again) or release the blog post to the public. Once released, a blog post cannot be edited. An ammendment can be written and added to the end of the blog post, and that will require the same process.  

This peer reveiw system will allow the blog to exist in a self sustainable capacity. Authors and reviewers will get a list of blog posts they've contributed to in their profile. This will be a great starting point for individuals looking to start their writing careers or who are passionate about video game writing. In addition, the historical conversations could be used if any legal issues were to arrise, especially with copyright protection enforcement being in flux within this particular niche.
