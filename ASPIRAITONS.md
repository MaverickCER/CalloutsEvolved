Welcome to Access Game Chat, where we're turning dreams into reality for gamers of all abilities!

Picture this: a gaming universe where everyone, regardless of their communication abilities, can conquer those epic endgame challenges and have a blast doing it. Destiny, Division, World of Warcraft – you name it, we're here to make sure everyone gets a shot at the glory!

Now, in the gaming realm, we've got some fantastic folks known as "Sherpas" who love guiding others through the treacherous terrain of gaming. But let's be honest, most gamers want to get the loot and jump into the next activity as quickly as possible. In order to that, the team must work well together and communicate. Good communication can overcome most gaps in skill, but even the most skilled gamer needs to meld with the team in order to obtain the goods. The problem is that not everyone can hop on the mic or hear what's happening in the gaming cosmos.

That's where we come in! We've been on a journey, crafting all sorts of nifty solutions. From speech recognition to snazzy soundboards to guides on achieving success without communication and everything in between, we've been trying to level the playing field.

Back in 2017, our friend James from nomadjsdev helped us cook up a prototype. You may have heard of it as Jarviss99-40. It was cool, gamers could join rooms and use a slick user interface to communicate with clicks and keyboard shortcuts. But, it was like crafting armor for every raid – it took ages, and we couldn't keep up with all the gaming goodies coming out.

Then came "Callouts Evolved." We learned loads about user interface and user experience (UI/UX), and it even managed to stand on its own two feet without traditional marketing. But guess what? We're ready for the big leagues now!

Access Game Chat is our game-changing vision! We're not just another gaming chat platform; we're aiming to be the go-to spot for all things gaming and accessibility. Imagine a peer-reviewed chat system where gamers write articles about accessibility in their favorite games. Picture a lively social space where users can share ideas, organize events, and document strategies.

And here's the real kicker: we're breaking down language barriers and communication restrictions. We're talking a day when someone fluent in Brazilian Sign Language can seamlessly chat with someone speaking French and another who's all about English – all in real-time and in their preferred way.

Now, we won't sugarcoat it – we've got quite the journey ahead of us. But here's what we hope: that you'll join us on this epic adventure. Tune in for insightful discussions, help us spread the word, and most importantly, let's have a blast together!
