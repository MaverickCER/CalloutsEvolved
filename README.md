This beta version of the site was built in react along with the ahk desktop app that allows users to trigger callouts with keyboard shortcuts without leaving their game. This was a big success and really helped me learn ReactJs and Redux. I attempted to add tracking and advertising but due to the lack of public facing unique content, the application was rejected. This is why the master branch now incorperates a blog and public lfg system in order to provide more public facing content. A discord bot was developed in discordjs v12 but has since been discontinued due to the release of discordjs v13 and the subsquent depreciation of features.
