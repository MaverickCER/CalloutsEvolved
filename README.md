<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Screenshot](https://github.com/MaverickCER/calloutsevolved/tree/main/assets/CELandingPage.png "calloutsevolved")

Callouts Evolved the niche website that got me started in web development. Over the years it's been through many variations and technologies. Checkout the readme files from the other branches in this repo to learn more about the history. At the time of release, the only related projects belong to major companies like Microsoft and Sony. They each provide speech to text and test to speech services to assist hard of hearing players double check what was said and ensure that they heard the correct callout. The end goal for Callouts Evolved is to allow gamers to send and receive communication however they want. Ultimately, we would love for a spanish gamer to speak in spanish to trigger a speech command that would send a visual callout in english to a deaf asl speaker or vice versa. 

Pros:
* Callouts are extremely customizable and can adapt to any scenario.
* Callouts are more actionable and instantly recognizable than solutions implemented by Microsoft or Sony.
* Our system strikes a balance between allowing gamers to focus on what's important while providing them access to the more social aspects of multiplayer games.

Cons:
* Multilingual support relies on images rather than text translation.
* No voice or video streaming support or screen sharing support.

The live site is available at [https://www.calloutsevolved.com](https://www.calloutsevolved.com)<br/>
There are no plans for an online IDE for this project.
